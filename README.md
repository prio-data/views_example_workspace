# ViEWS 3 (views cloud) example repository

## [Follow this tutorial](https://github.com/prio-data/viewser/wiki/Quickstart)

This repository demonstrates how to work with views cloud locally. The only
dependency is the `viewser` package (> 0.3.0), which can be installed with 
`pip install viewser`.

After installing viewser, it must be configured. Run `viewser configure` 
and enter the address of a server running views cloud.

Then, you can run the script in this repository with `python country_month_queryset.py`,
which will define a queryset and download the data to your working directory.
